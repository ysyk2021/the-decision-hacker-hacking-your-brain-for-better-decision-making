Identifying Common Biases and Heuristics
==================================================================================================

Cognitive biases and heuristics can impact decision-making by leading us to make irrational or suboptimal choices. In this chapter, we will explore common cognitive biases and heuristics that can affect decision-making.

Confirmation Bias
-----------------

Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek out information that confirms our existing beliefs or opinions while disregarding information that contradicts them. This bias can lead to a narrow perspective and a failure to consider alternative options.

Availability Heuristic
----------------------

The availability heuristic is the tendency to rely on readily available information rather than seeking out additional information. For example, someone may choose a product based solely on the fact that it is advertised more frequently, without considering other factors such as quality or price.

Anchoring Bias
--------------

Anchoring bias is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making a decision. For example, a homebuyer may anchor their offer to the asking price, even if it is not an accurate reflection of the property's value.

Status Quo Bias
---------------

Status quo bias is the tendency to favor the current state of affairs over alternative options. This bias can result in a resistance to change, even when change may be beneficial.

Overconfidence Bias
-------------------

Overconfidence bias is the tendency to overestimate one's abilities or the accuracy of one's judgments. This bias can lead to a failure to consider alternative perspectives or data that contradicts one's assumptions.

By becoming aware of these common cognitive biases and heuristics, decision-makers can develop strategies for overcoming them and making more informed and rational decisions.
